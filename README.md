### About Kven language

Kven is a member of the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family, and is closely related to Finnish. For political and historical reasons, it received the status of a minority language in 2005 within the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Linguistically, however, it is seen as a mutually intelligible dialect of the Finnish language, and grouped together with the Peräpohjola dialects
